# Fibonacci
In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1. Starting from 0 and 1, the first few values in the sequence are:
```python
Fn  =   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...

Index = 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7   8   9   10  11  12...
```
This function is made to work as the example above 

## Instalation

There is no need to install, just download and use it in other programs. 
Also if you want to test you can run the test_fibonacci.py

```bash
python3 ./example/directory/test_fibonnaci.py
```

To download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/um-computacion-tm/fibonacci-EVAnci.git
```

## How it works

The function **fibonacci(number)** returns a fibonacci number given a index. The index follows the sequence given in the first example

## Usage

Just import fibonacci to your python program, or copy the function **fibonacci** into your program.

To import copy the following:

```python
from fibonacci import fibonacci
```
